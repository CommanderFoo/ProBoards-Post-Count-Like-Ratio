Post Count Like Ratio
=====================

Adds a ratio to mini profiles based on the post count and total likes received.

For this to work, you need to add this to your mini profile template:

```
<br /><span class="post-count-like-ratio" data-user-like-count="$[user.likes]" data-user-post-count="$[user.posts]"></span>
```
